# FBNotifyClear
A cydia substrate which would help you to clear the cached notifications from Facebook.app easily. Dont you think your notifications you getting in your app are less fewer than the desktop webview. Yes it is. As for me, I logged out from app and logged in again for checking my notifications fully. This tiny tweak could help you for it without need to be logged out.

You should use [Kirb's Theos] (https://github.com/kirb/theos) to compile this package.

### Libs used:
